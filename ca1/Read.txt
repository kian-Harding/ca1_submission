Hey peadar i just wanted to leave a msg to you saying why i havent been in.

my class on the software side only has 6 members and none of them show it was mostly me on my own all last semester I didn't want to go through that again this semester.

i also lost a family member near the end of the first semester.

Which i know is no excuse for missing soo much.

I tried this ca and was struggling i figured out the lambda stuff but the yaml file and how to upload im really not sure.

I will be trying to attend in the future which i cant promise and i will be sending you an email about this aswell.
